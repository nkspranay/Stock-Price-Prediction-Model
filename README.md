## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using historical stock price data.

## Steps
1. Fetch historical stock data using yfinance
2. Perform feature engineering (moving averages, returns, volatility)
3. Train a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate the model using MAE and RMSE

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Limitations
Stock prices are influenced by external factors such as news and market sentiment. This model learns historical patterns but cannot reliably predict future prices.
